## Hey there! 👋✨
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’m an HR professional who approaches people decisions through the lens of **data, probability, and market logic**.  
I believe HR is most valuable when it operates like a business function—using analytical reasoning to **predict workforce risks, optimize decisions, and drive measurable value**.

My work combines **HR expertise, data analytics, mathematical thinking, and market insight** to transform raw information into clear, actionable strategies that support business growth.  
I stay committed to objectivity, structured reasoning, and continuous learning—because the most effective decisions come from evidence, not assumptions.

Here’s to building smarter, data-driven organizations—one analysis at a time. 🚀
