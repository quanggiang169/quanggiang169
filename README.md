## Hey there, friend! 👋✨
🌟 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m excited to share my journey as a curious data lover on a mission to become an HR Data Analyst. I believe data has the power to change the way we think about people and workplaces. I'm passionate about discovering insights that can make HR practices better and help create awesome experiences for everyone at work.

✨ With a mindset rooted in consistency and a love for lifelong learning, I’m always eager to dive into new ideas and grow. One of my favorite quotes is by Feynman: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.” This reminds me to stay honest with myself in both my personal and professional journey. It encourages me to embrace self-reflection, challenge my assumptions, and continuously seek the truth in data, leading to more informed and authentic decisions.

☕ When I’m not crunching numbers, you’ll find me enjoying little adventures—whether it’s sipping coffee at my favorite spot or wandering through nature. I love making connections and soaking in those little moments that inspire me. Here’s to making a positive impact in HR, one fun analysis at a time!
